Intro:

In this project we decided to create a game to teach the use of Terminal. The motive was to create a game in which you navigate through a file system using Terminal commands and delete certain files which you may find malicious. To win the game you’d have to delete all the files which were ‘viruses’. The concept is that you are a terminator for viruses and malware and use the Terminal, hence The Terminalator. 

Currently the game itself is not fully implemented due to issues we had with putting together the filesystem with the commands and website, however the idea is still there and can be fixed given more time.


Using the repo:

The ‘PseudoFileSystem.py’ file contains the actual filesystem and how it would be implemented in the real game. This is just a python file which uses OOP and ADT.

The “Terminal Wars” folder is a Unity Game Project which can be run using Unity. This is a more refined system with a working Terminal.
